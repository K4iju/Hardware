- Support for up to 64 GB of memory

## Step 2: Prepare the Work Area

1. Ensure you have a clean, static-free work area.
2. Gather all necessary tools (e.g., screwdriver).

## Step 3: Install the Motherboard

1. Open the computer case.
2. Locate and screw in the standoffs to the appropriate positions in the case.
3. Align the motherboard with the standoffs and I/O shield at the back of the case.
4. Carefully place the motherboard into the case, ensuring all ports align with the I/O shield.
5. Secure the motherboard with screws.

## Step 4: Connect the Computer Case Cables

1. **Power Switch:**
   - Connect the power switch cable to the motherboard's power switch pins.
2. **Reset Switch:**
   - Connect the reset switch cable to the reset switch pins on the motherboard.
3. **Power LED (3-1 pin):**
   - Connect the power LED cable to the appropriate pins on the motherboard.
4. **HDD LED:**
   - Connect the HDD LED cable to the HDD LED pins on the motherboard.
5. **Speaker:**
   - Connect the speaker cable to the speaker pins on the motherboard.
6. **Front Fan:**
   - Connect the front fan cable to the motherboard's fan header.
7. **Rear Fan:**
   - Connect the rear fan cable to the appropriate fan header on the motherboard.
8. **USB (Black cable - 2.0):**
   - Connect the USB 2.0 cable to the USB 2.0 header on the motherboard.
9. **Front Panel Audio:**
   - Connect the front panel audio cable to the motherboard’s audio header.
10. **USB 3.0:**
    - Connect the USB 3.0 cable to the USB 3.0 header on the motherboard.

## Step 5: Connect the Power Supply Connectors

1. **CPU Power:**
   - Connect the 4-pin or 8-pin CPU power connector to the motherboard’s CPU power socket.
2. **Main Motherboard Power:**
   - Connect the 24-pin main power connector to the motherboard’s main power socket.

## Final Checks

1. Ensure all connections are secure.
2. Verify that there are no loose screws or components.
3. Close the computer case.
